# Flask Blog
## Frontend
Nothing fancy, good old Bootstrap CSS.

## Backend
Used Flask, and sqllite db.

## How to Use
Open git bash in the directory containing run.py. Then start Python from command line. Then: 



```
>>> from flask_blog import db
>>> db.create_all()
>>> exit()
```
Fine? 

```
>>> python run.py
```
Head to [localhost:5000](https://localhost:5000). Enjoy!
